# TreePainterProject
A javaFX-Application where you can draw trees 

An Application I made for a coding assignment. Where you can add random trees that relatively look smaller the further away a tree is.
Play a movie to let them move for a landscape aesthetic feeling.
Or add 100 trees immediately. And save it to your desktop too :)
